//! Guest V registers kept in host XMM registers within one block.
//!
//! A system-mode block ([`super::block`]) gives the AdvSIMD operand layer
//! ([`super::simd::read_vector`], [`super::simd::commit`],
//! [`super::simd::vector_source`]) a pool of host XMM registers that no
//! recipe names: XMM8 to XMM15. Recipes keep their fixed scratch registers
//! XMM0 to XMM7. A guest vector gets a home in the pool when a recipe
//! commits a result to it or takes it as a source operand; later reads take
//! it from there, and commits write there and mark it dirty, instead of
//! storing to `GuestState::v` and loading it back at once.
//!
//! The state block is made current ([`VectorCache::flush`]) wherever
//! anything else may read it: before every instruction that can fault or
//! leave the block (a guest access or check, a conditional branch's side
//! exit, the terminal and its direct exits, a self-loop's back edge) and
//! before every instruction the cache does not know (which also forgets
//! every home, since it may write `GuestState::v` itself or use any XMM
//! register). So a fault's settlement, an exit, a helper and an interrupt
//! taken at a block boundary all find the exact architectural V state, and
//! the precise-exception, SMC and interrupt rules of the blocks are the
//! ones they had: the cache never holds a dirty register across a fault
//! site ([`super::asm::Code::guest_access`] asserts it) or a branch out.
//!
//! The pool is the legacy-SSE register file's upper half on every x86-64
//! host: SSE2 recipes take a home directly as a source operand, which
//! XMM16 to XMM31 (AVX-512VL, EVEX only) cannot be.
//!
//! Those sixteen are a second bank on AVX-512VL hosts, for values recipes
//! derive and use again later in the block (a prepared by-element operand,
//! lane constants): [`Code::derived`]. EVEX forms read them; nothing
//! stores them; a value goes when its source vector is written, when the
//! bank needs its register, and wherever the cache forgets its homes, so
//! no fault site, exit or helper depends on one.
